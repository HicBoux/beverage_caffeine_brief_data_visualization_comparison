      <h1>What is the cheapest drink to stay awake ?</h1>
	  <p><b>Is it worthier to take coffees or energy drinks ? Unless you are used to enjoy teas ?</b></p>
	  </div>
	  <div class="wrapper">
	  <p>Most people use to drink coffees in their daily life at their working place or even at home. But is it the most economical way to get energy (after sleeping) ? If
	  we compare it with other products in terms of caffeine concentration, coffee wins easily the battle. Below a bar chart showing it. 
	  <p>We have sorted various beverages by type : Coca Cola, Diet Coke and Pepsi as <em>"sodas"</em>, Red Bull and Monster as <em>"energy drinks"</em>, 
	  coffees produced by Dolce Gusto pods/capsules as <em>"pod coffees"</em>, Lipton and Pure Leaf iced drinks as <em>"iced teas"</em>, some Lipton tea bags as 
	  <em>"tea Infusions"</em>, and Starbucks/Macdonalds Coffees as <em>"fast food coffees"</em>.</p><br><br>

	<p>Although "Pod Coffees" could have a fewer concentration because of an imperfect filtration of the coffee in the capsule, they are from far the bests. So we are led to think
	that they are the most efficient drink ever to stay awake. However, I'm sure you've already had the feeling that the "machine" coffee at the office was less strong than a good one in a coffeeshop
	like Starbucks, haven't you ?</p>
	
	<p>It's because pod coffees are actually weaker. Indeed, the results are quite different if you take your beverage in its traditional format (can for sodas, long cups for fast 
	food coffees)) :</p><br><br>
	
	<canvas id="bar-chart-traditional-caffeine-concentration-by-drink" width="800" height="450"></canvas>
	
	<p>So if you have only time for one drink, the best solution is without doubt a Starbucks Caffe Mocha Grande.</p>
	<p>However, one important aspect is missing in the reasoning : the price ! That's why I checked how does each drink cost on the <a href="https://grocery.walmart.com/">Walmart's official grocery website</a> and 
	the menus of <a href="https://www.fastfoodmenuprices.com/starbucks-prices/">Starbucks</a> and <a href="https://www.fastfoodmenuprices.com/mcdonalds-prices/">McDonald</a> in California.
	Then, if we divide the occuring caffeine by the related price of the beverage, we get an "efficiency" rate as following :</p><br><br>
	
	<canvas id="bar-chart-coffee-dollar-rate-by-group" width="800" height="450"></canvas><br><br>
	
	<p>Tea infusions are the indisputed winners ! If you are ready to drink a lot of water and not afraid to go to the toilets every 5 minute, they are from far the cheapest drink
	to stay awake. You can moreover find them almost everywhere ! So if you wish to make huge spare of money this year, you know what to do. :)</p><br><br>
	
	<h1>Methodology :</h1><br><br>
	
	I took caffeine concentrations from the <a href="caffeineinformer.com">Caffeine Informer Website</a> or from the official producer article descriptions or websites.
	About the prices, I decided to take the ones of a random famous american chain of supermarkets, like Walmart. Thus I got them on their 
	<a href="https://grocery.walmart.com/">grocery shop</a>. I couldn't buy through it some products like the prepared ones of fast foods or the pod coffees. That's why 
	I checked for Starbucks and McDonalds this comparator <a href="">website</a> and the official pricing of <a href="https://www.dolce-gusto.us/">Dolce Gusto USA</a>. All information are available on the Excel spreadsheet that I created
	by collecting the data and that I joined with this source code.
